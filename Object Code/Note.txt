Since both modes (interactive and batch) use the same modules, and they are writing the output of the 
execution into a "mips.obj" file, I provide a separate object code here. The script outputs the same 
object code as this, when running the first time in batch mode. After that, it overrites the execution 
outputs to the object code generated by that whether it is run under batch mode again or interactive mode. 

Also, "mips2.src" file will be generated by the script in first run, which is the rearranged version of the 
"mips.src" file.
